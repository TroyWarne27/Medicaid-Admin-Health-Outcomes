# Summary

This repository is for work done in STATA over the course of a semester in my graduate coursework at University of Nevada Reno. This is a two part analysis investigating (1) the impact of adminstrative spending by state Medicaid programs on the adminstrative cost burden of hospitals for billing and insurance related activities and (2) the impact of the level of adminstrative cost burden for these activities on metrics for the quality of care received at the same hospitals.
